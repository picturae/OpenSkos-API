         *   add them in after that.
         *
         * We break this up into the following steps
         *
         * 1) Find all the URI's of entities we have to recall. Record which position(s) in the entity array it has to
         *      placed in.
         * 2) Fetch all entities from step 1 in a single query
         * 3) Walk through the query results, and use the data from step 1 to place them into the entity store.
